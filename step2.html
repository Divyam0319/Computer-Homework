living, rising medical costs, causes global warming and also causes the destruction of the ozone layer. Water pollution changes the taste of 
water and brings about harmful chemical changes. Water pollution harms marine life and causes serious illnesses when drunk. Besides, some of the 
causes of land pollution are the use of pesticides, agricultural and industrial waste, deforestation, growing urbanization, acid rains, and 
mining activities. Furthermore, these activities not only cause damage to the soil but also the reason for various human and animal infections
and diseases.
